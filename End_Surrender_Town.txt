	Not wishing to risk bloodshed and thinking of {his} family, {name} took the first option on the table.
	Though it took some later argument with Sir Johnny Swordfish, the deal was struck and the marauders returned their prisoners. In exchange, the townspeople left their town--their homes, belongings, and everything they knew--to be ransacked.
	It was difficult on all of them, with most villagers thanking {name} for saving their lives, but the thanks were all empty...
	... save from Sally and her gang, who gladly took in the thoughtful, intelligent villager to their ranks.
	{name} would go on to be an outcast, as nobody would want to associate with the one who surrendered their homes and livelihoods...
	... but, perhaps, {name} could live with that, knowing that {his} family and everyone he knew would go on to live another day.

END: SURRENDER TOWN
