print("----------")
print("{name} is a commoner, living in a small, idyllic village in a grand fantasy kingdom.".format(name=player.name))
print("In recent times, people have been speaking of monsters who seek to assail the kingdom at large...")
print("... but such must be mere fairy tales, right?")
print("----------")
print("{name} awakens to the scent of smoke and the sounds of screaming.".format(name=player.name))
print("The town must be under attack!")
print("{he} knows that somewhere in the house, his parents kept a weapon for self defense...".format(he=player.name))
print("... but {he} would have to spend time trying to find it.".format(he=player.gender[0]))
print("Alternatively, {he} could try to slip out the back window.".format(he=player.gender[0]))
print("What to do...")
print("1) Weapon \n 2) Window")
Protagonist_Awakens = input("Select: ")
print("You have chosen: " + Protagonist_Awakens)
