	... and drew {his} family's weapons. Parries, jabs, dodges and dives were pronounced for the full minute of the duel, where {name} was struck time and again. 
	With {his} family's weapons, {he} was at least able to put up a fight and keep most of the injuries from growing particularly severe.
	However, there was no way to defeat a professional warrior without taking a huge risk, so {name} lunged from the floor after completing a sideways roll...
	... only to find {himself} impaled upon a spear at the same time {his} weapon found purchase in the flesh of the leader's neck.
	As he gurgled and fell dead, the remaining marauders retreated--respecting the fact that their best had been felled by little more than a villager.
	{name}, however, would not live to see {his} parents freed, {his} town spared, or the statue erected in {his} honour...
	... but the sacrifice of one for many is no less profound.
